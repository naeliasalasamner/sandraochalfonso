This page of our story symbolises and carries the intention, for us, of becoming a family and the joy of sharing a life. In that, we found a deeper love surfacing, one that we are excited to hold in ceremony. We keep re-discovering our path in life, small and big. We never thought this day would come and here we are!"

    "text": "A Swedish wedding tradition is to hold speeches during the dinner (we really love this!). The speech generally contains some loving words towards the bridal couple, maybe a funny anecdote or a beautiful wish. It does not need to be big! So if you want to hop on this train you will need to write it down and send it to XXXXX two weeks before the wedding so that it can be translated (in written). You can always write something and then speak from your heart in the moment but then at least everyone gets a chance to hear you."

Swedish summers are very bright and lovely but it can be around 18 degrees. We are going to be on grass so don't bring heels (also we want to see you on the dancefloor!)."

    "text": "Some of you we haven't seen in a long time and you might have traveled far and we would love to create a little bit more time to hangout and enjoy the afterglow together! The celebration will end around 1pm and a bus will take everyone back to Malmö. But if you wish and have the possibility to stay until the 14th we invite you to come to our house in Malmö (on the Saturday and Sunday). Maybe we will organise a brunch in the city somewhere and then go back to our garden and hang out there (play games, drink coffee, beers, chat, be cozy, have a sauna… the sky is the limit) or if it is really nice weather maybe go to the beach and have a swim, order some pizzas for the night. We live in Ljunggatan 28, so you could book a place to sleep close by and then find your flow into the afterglow! Just let us know if you have any questions."

  "closingwords": {
    "text": "Some people say that a relationship is a great deal of work, and a marriage even more so. We have been pondering about this, now soon being wedded. And maybe it is not love that needs the work but the relationship that frames it that does - it needs dedication, be figured out, compromised on, built together, renewed, and formed. But maybe love is something so simple, that spontaneously strikes us. And maybe we just need each other to be reminded of that, to come back into our hearts and let love touch us.",
    "closing": "We are so looking forward to sharing this celebration with you all and feel so grateful to have such amazing friends and family! We hope it will be wonderful, wild, touching and fun!",
