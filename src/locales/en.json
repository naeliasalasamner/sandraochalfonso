Therefore we will hold the ceremony in English and Spanish. This will make everything a bit longer but we hope it will contribute to the space and offer a possibility for more slowness and depth.\n\nSpeeches: There will be a possibility to hold a speech during the dinner (we really love this!). If you wish to do so, you will need to write it down and send it to XXXXX two weeks before the wedding so that it can be translated (in written). You can always write something and then speak from your heart in the moment, but then at least everyone gets a chance to hear you."

The celebration will end around 1pm and a bus will take everyone back to Malmö. But if you wish and have the possibility to stay until the 14th, we invite you to come to our house in Malmö (on the Saturday and Sunday). Maybe we will organise a brunch in the city somewhere and then go back to our garden and hang out there (play games, drink coffee, beers, chat, be cozy, have a sauna… the sky is the limit), or if the weather is really nice, maybe go to the beach and have a swim and order some pizzas for the night. We live at Ljunggatan 28, so you could book a place to sleep close by and then find your flow into the afterglow! Just let us know if you have any questions."
